Hierarchical Biometrical Genetic State Space Model: code to accompany manuscript

These are the supplemental files for:
McKee, K. L., (2021) Hierarchical Biometrical Genetic Analysis of Dynamics. Behavior Genetics
(in final review with Behavior Genetics as of this commit )

The stan models include a simple AR(1) model with the autoregressive coefficient distributed according to genetic and environmental sources of variation, and a damped linear oscillator with frequency and damping parameters distributed according to a multivariate biometrical genetic model.

The R script runs simulations to analyze the power and accuracy of estimates from the simpler AR(1) model.
